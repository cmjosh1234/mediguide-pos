# MediGuide

MediGuide is a clinical-guidance platform composed of a public guidelines site,
an administrative dashboard, a typed API, an AI/RAG ingestion worker, and an
offline-first Flutter application. The monorepo ships development and production
Docker Compose stacks, generated API contracts, mobile release automation, and
Firebase-backed push notifications and Remote Config.

## Repository map

| Directory | Purpose | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [`backend`](backend/README.md) | Typed API, authentication, authorization, migrations and seed data | Go, Gin, GORM, PostgreSQL |
| [`dashboard`](dashboard/README.md) | Staff administration and guideline authoring | Next.js, TypeScript, Bun |
| [`guidelines-platform`](guidelines-platform/README.md) | Public clinical-guidelines experience | React, Vite |
| [`user_app`](user_app/README.md) | Offline-first clinician application | Flutter, Riverpod, Drift |
| [`ai-worker`](ai-worker/README.md) | PDF/Markdown ingestion, extraction, embeddings and RAG | Python, FastAPI |
| [`infra`](infra/README.md) | Development and production orchestration | Docker Compose, Nginx |

Supporting services include PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, MinIO and Ollama. The
root [`VERSION`](VERSION) is the source of truth for unified releases.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:

- Docker with Compose v2
- GNU Make
- Git
- Flutter `3.44.8` through FVM for mobile development
- Bun for dashboard work
- Node.js for the guidelines site and release scripts
- Go and Python only when running backend or AI services outside Docker

Start the complete local platform:

```bash
make config
make up
make ps
```

On Windows, use native GNU Make from PowerShell or Command Prompt, and Docker
Desktop configured for Linux containers. The Makefiles select `cmd.exe` and
use `python` for local AI commands. Git for Windows is required for targets
that run Bash scripts, including `env-check`, `contracts`, and `release-check`.
If Git is installed outside `C:/Program Files/Git`, pass its Bash path:

```powershell
make env-check "GIT_BASH=D:/Apps/Git/bin/bash.exe"
make ai-test "PYTHON=py -3"
make run-cfdp-android ANDROID_DEVICE=emulator-5554
```

Install the relevant Go, Python, Node, Bun, or Flutter tools for the targets you
run locally and make them available on `PATH`. Backend builds produce `.exe`
files on Windows. The iOS simulator target requires macOS. WSL uses the Linux
recipes and tools installed inside WSL.

The committed `infra/development.env` contains safe local defaults.
`infra/staging.env.example` and `infra/production.env.example` use the same
variable schema with environment-specific placeholders. Run `make env-check`
after adding or renaming an infrastructure variable; the check also validates
ignored local staging and production files when they exist.
See the complete [three-environment configuration guide](infra/README.md#environment-configuration)
for file creation, Firebase injection, validation, CI handling, and secret
boundaries.

Default local endpoints:

| Application | URL |
|---|---|
| Guidelines | <http://localhost:5173> |
| Dashboard | <http://localhost:3000/admin> |
| API | <http://localhost:8080> |
| API readiness | <http://localhost:8080/api/readyz> |
| MinIO console | <http://localhost:9001> |

Useful commands:

```bash
make logs                 # follow all containers
make env-check            # verify environment and Compose variable parity
make guidelines-logs      # follow the public frontend
make down                 # stop and preserve data
make reset                # destructive: stop and delete development volumes
make seed                 # seed a locally configured backend (see seeding guide)
make contracts            # regenerate Go/TypeScript/Dart contracts
make contracts-check      # verify contract drift
make test                 # backend and AI-worker tests
```

See [`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md) for ports, health checks, volumes,
production Compose, reverse-proxy routing and deployment.
Use [`docs/seeding.md`](docs/seeding.md) for deterministic local demo data and
guarded production administrator/facility metadata seeding.

## Mobile environments

The Flutter app has three installable flavors:

| Environment | Android ID | iOS bundle ID | Entry point |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development | `com.mediguide.ug.dev` | `com.omarsoft.mediguide.dev` | `lib/main_development.dart` |
| Staging | `com.mediguide.ug.staging` | `com.omarsoft.mediguide.staging` | `lib/main_staging.dart` |
| Production | `com.mediguide.ug` | `com.omarsoft.mediguide` | `lib/main_production.dart` |

Run development locally:

```bash
cd user_app
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run \
  --flavor development \
  --target lib/main_development.dart \
  --dart-define-from-file=/secure/mediguide/firebase-development.json
```

Development and staging builds include the draggable debug-tools badge with
network, Remote Config and build inspectors. Production code disables those
tools. Full flavor and Xcode setup is in
[`docs/mobile-environments.md`](docs/mobile-environments.md).

## Firebase

Firebase provides mobile Analytics, Cloud Messaging, Remote Config and App
Distribution. Administrative push and Remote Config operations pass through the
backend; Firebase Admin credentials never enter a frontend image or mobile app.

The abbreviated setup is:

1. Create separate development, staging and production Firebase projects.
2. Register the matching Android and iOS IDs from the table above.
3. Enable Analytics, Cloud Messaging, Remote Config and App Distribution.
4. Upload the APNs key and enable iOS Push Notifications/background delivery.
5. Create the documented Remote Config parameters.
6. Configure backend Admin credentials.
7. Configure protected GitHub `testing` and `production` environments.
8. Create `mediguide-alpha-testers`, `mediguide-beta-testers`, and
   `mediguide-testers` App Distribution groups.
9. Run the status, Remote Config and test-push verification checklist.

Follow the complete copy-and-paste process in
[`docs/firebase-mobile-distribution.md`](docs/firebase-mobile-distribution.md).

### Backend Firebase credentials

The API and notification worker use a backend-only service account; this is
different from the mobile client configuration and the App Distribution CI
account. Create one service account per Firebase environment and grant only:

- Firebase Cloud Messaging API Admin (`roles/firebasecloudmessaging.admin`);
- Firebase Remote Config Admin (`roles/cloudconfig.admin`).

Download its JSON key to an approved location outside the repository. Validate
the path before encoding it; an empty `$key_file` produces `Can't open "" for
reading`:

```bash
key_file="/secure/mediguide/mediguide-staging-backend.json"

test -r "$key_file" || {
  echo "Service-account file not found: $key_file"
  exit 1
}

jq -e '
  .type == "service_account" and
  (.project_id | length > 0) and
  (.client_email | length > 0) and
  (.private_key | length > 0)
' "$key_file"

openssl base64 -A \
  -in "$key_file" \
  -out "/secure/mediguide/mediguide-staging-backend.base64"
```

Use `key_file`, without a backslash before the underscore, and do not leave a
trailing `\` on the final command line. Never print, commit or paste the JSON or
base64 value into an issue or chat. `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` expects
the encoded contents, not a filename or path. For a local Compose session,
inject the value without storing it in the tracked development environment:

```bash
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64="$(tr -d '\r\n' \
  < "$HOME/.config/mediguide/firebase/mediguide-development-backend.base64")"

docker compose \
  --env-file infra/development.env \
  -f infra/docker-compose.yml \
  -f infra/docker-compose.dev.yml \
  up -d --no-deps --force-recreate api notification-worker

unset FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64
```

Set the matching values in the protected Compose environment:

```dotenv
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=mediguide-staging
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=BASE64_JSON_HERE
FIREBASE_DEVICE_STALE_DAYS=90
```

`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` must exactly match `project_id` inside the decoded JSON.
Production values belong in the ignored `infra/production.env`; upload the
complete file to the protected GitHub Environment after preserving every other
required setting:

```bash
gh secret set PRODUCTION_ENV_FILE \
  --repo mohuganda/mediguide-pos \
  --env production \
  < infra/production.env
```

Recreate the services after changing credentials because a container restart
does not reload environment variables:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file infra/production.env \
  -f infra/docker-compose.yml \
  up -d --no-deps --force-recreate api notification-worker
```

The full least-privilege setup, local-development flow, APNs configuration,
GitHub secrets and verification checklist remain in
[`docs/firebase-mobile-distribution.md`](docs/firebase-mobile-distribution.md#backend-firebase-admin-setup).

## Security expectations

- Never commit `.env` files containing real credentials, Firebase Admin JSON,
  signing keys, provisioning profiles, keystores or App Store Connect keys.
- Client Firebase identifiers are not Admin credentials, but environment bundles
  remain in GitHub secrets to prevent cross-environment configuration drift.
- Production operations use protected GitHub environments and immutable tags.
- Keep database, Redis, MinIO, Ollama and worker ports private in production.
- Clinical content and AI responses must not be treated as a substitute for
  professional judgment or local Ministry of Health policy.
